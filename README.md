**Coordinate.java**: scratched project due to convoluted coding due to coding solutions on the fly and coding lots of work arounds.  

> - To help avoid having to scratch or unnecessary rework of code I read about [psuedocoding](https://www.wikihow.com/Write-Pseudocode)     
and will implement it in the future

**other files:**

>- create packages in eclipse to better orginize src files rather than using default.
>- need to work on commenting coding activities and challenges dispite working under short time constraints.
